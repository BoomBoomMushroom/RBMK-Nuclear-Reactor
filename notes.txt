Gird of elements (X by Y)
- You control the percent of it that is uranium

Uranium 235
- When hit by neutron:
    1: Make the uranium spent
    2: Release 3 neutrons
- Spent uranium has an X percent chance (You control it) to go back into normal Uranium

Xenon 135
- Can absorb neutrons just like Control Rods
- When hit by neutron:
    1: Make the xenon burnt
    2: Absorbs the neutrons
- Spent uranium has an X percent chance (You control it) to turn into Xenon

Neutrons
- Two Types
    1: Fast Neutron (just the outline or something) | Cannot be absorbed by control rods nor elements | The default state of neutrons
    2: Regular Neutron

Moderator
- When a fast neutron hits it:
    The fast neutron turns into a normal neutron (and is reflected like hitting a wall)
- When a normal neutron hits it:
    It passes right through it


Radioactive Decay
- All elements can spontaniously release a neutron. You control the percent chance that it does per spawn chance (idk like chance every 5s)

Control Rods
- Absorb Neutrons

Water
- Chance to absorb a neutron
- When neutron and water are touching the water heats up
- Three states. Transparent Blue = Regular Water | Red-Orange = Hot/Boiling | Empty Space = Evaporated (Can't absorb neutrons)
- Water can cool down, and condensate back into boiling, then regular water
~ Maybe add where water (not evaporated) can even out the temperature within the system by sharing it w/ it's neighbors
